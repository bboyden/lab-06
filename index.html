<p>
  This lab was like my intro to working with JavaScript classes, and it was actually kinda fun. I made a <code>Book</code> class and then a <code>Library</code> class that could hold books, just like a real one (but, you know, in code). I added a couple books, gave them ISBNs, and even figured out how to delete one. It felt very much like building a tiny, nerdy app. Also got to work with GitHub some more and practiced good habits.
